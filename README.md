# SARS-CoV-2-ensemble-model
Found here is the R code used to generate the mathematical modelling results found in the paper titled "Ensemble modeling of SARS-CoV-2 immune dynamics in immunologically na√Øve rhesus macaques predicts that potent, early innate immune responses drive viral elimination". All code was written by Catherine Byrne. All queries can be directed to cbyrne@fredhutch.org.

Data comes from _Nelson et al. Mild SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques is associated with viral control prior to antigen-specific T cell responses in tissues. Sci Immunol (2022) 7:eabo0535. doi: 10.1126/sciimmunol.abo0535_. The subset of data used in this analysis can be found in the file titled "all_dat_extrapolated.csv". Other data from this study can be found on NCBI GEO under accession GSE196980 and in the Supplementary Materials of the original paper.
